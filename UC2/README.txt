[[ State of the Game ]] // as of the alpha release date: Dec. 2, 2015

The game essentially is in two pieces. The networking part is not integrated with the main game. Instead we have two parts:
one that is a network test/development provided by Nikolay, and the other is the development of the main game. The network part is
merged from Nikolay's NetWorked UC branch, and my portion of the game is merged from the Develop branch.
